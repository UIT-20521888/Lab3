# Differential Evolution (DE) and Cross Entropy Method (CEM)
We install Differential Evolution (DE) and Cross Entropy Method (CEM)
Improved version to optimize the following objective functions:
1. f1: Sphere (d = 2 variables and 10 variables).
2. f2: Zakharov (d = 2 variables and 10 variables).
3. f3: Rosenbrock (d = 2 variables and 10 variables).
4. f4: Michalewicz (d = 2 variables and 10 variables).
5. f5: Ackley (d = 2 variables and 10 variables).

Information about these functions: formula of objective function, domain of value (search domain), global minima, you can refer to the following link:
